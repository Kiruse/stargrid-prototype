# Stargrid
*Stargrid* is a prototype for a [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) reverse proxy. *Stargrid* is designed to ease the load on full nodes by allowing multiple tenants to connect to *Stargrid* rather than the full nodes directly, balancing load, repeating blocks & txs, and (eventually) queuing event logs.

Other applications could build on top of *Stargrid* to respond to arbitrary blockchain transactions such as NFT sales or coin transfers, keep a private ledger, build a time series database for price charting, or track a wallet's activity in realtime.

# State of this Work
The prototype is functional, but further development is currently on hold indefinitely.
